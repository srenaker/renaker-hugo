This instrument is the other half of my single-manual Colmar Ruckers pair, completed in March 2010 and sold to a
Bay Area customer. Its compass
is 56 notes, G to d transposing, with two 8-foot choirs.

The soundboard painting and nameboard lettering are by Elizabeth Fifield, and the Flemish papers in the
keywell and inner case are by Grant O'Brien. I painted the outer case and lid myself.

Many thanks to Elaine Thornburgh for testing out the new instrument, and to
[Sisto Flores](http://www.youtube.com/user/queswerte) for his video expertise!
