This instrument was completed in 2013, a French double-manual instrument based
on the Taskin of 1769.  It has a compass of 61 notes, five octaves from FF to ff,
transposable from A=415 to A=440.  It has two 8-foot choirs, a 4-foot choir, and a 
buff stop. The soundboard was painted by Janine Johnson. It was bought by a Bay Area
customer in 2020.

The soundboard painting is by Janine Johnson, and the Flemish papers are by
Grant O'Brien.
