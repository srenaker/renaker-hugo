This is another Flemish single-manual modeled 
after the Colmar Ruckers of 1624, using the
same design as my last instrument. It has a compass of 
56 notes, G to d transposing from A=415 to A=440, with two 8-foot choirs. 

The soundboard painting is by Janine Johnson, and the Flemish papers are by
Grant O'Brien. It was bought by a Bay Area customer in 2019.
