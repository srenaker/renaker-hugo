This instrument is one half of a pair I built based on a harpsichord built by Ioannes Ruckers in 1624, known as the 'Colmar' Ruckers (because the original is in a museum in Colmar, France). This is a single-manual version of what was originally a double-manual instrument, and I changed the dimensions slightly to accomodate a transposing note, allowing it to play at either A=415 or A=440 pitch levels.

The soundboard painting is by Janine Johnson, the nameboard lettering is by Elizabeth Fifield, and the Flemish papers in the keywell and inner case are by Grant O'Brien. I painted the outer case and lid.
