This instrument was completed in 2022, a Flemish double-manual instrument based
on the Colmar Ruckers of 1624.  Its compass
is 56 notes, G to d transposing, with two 8-foot choirs, a 4-foot choir, and a 
buff stop. The soundboard was painted by Janine Johnson. It remains in my personal
collection and is available for short-term rental.

The soundboard painting is by Janine Johnson, and the Flemish papers are by
Adrian Card.
