title: "About"
description: "I live and work in Palo Alto, California. I've spent my career in the tech industry, but
I do various kinds of harpsichord projects from time to time. I've built and sold several instruments,
and I occasionally do tuning for concerts. If you need a rental instrument or a repair done, feel free
to reach out to renaker@yahoo.com and I'll see what I can do."
